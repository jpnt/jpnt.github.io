      <title>Take Notes on VIM</title>

      <description>There are a lot of programs to take notes on, however, if you use VIM, why not take notes on your own text editor?
Install a plugin manager Make sure you have some type of VIM plugin manager installed. Personally, I use ´vim-plug´.
Install ´vim-plug´ for VIM, on Unix based systems:
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim Documentation is available at: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
Install vimwiki Edit ´~/.vimrc´ to configure VIM and make it use vimwiki:</description>

      <description>SSH Daemon Configuration File The SSH daemon settings can be entirely configured through its configuration file located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Use your favorite text editor to change it.
Recommended settings:

Private -&amp;gt; Client
Public -&amp;gt; Server
 Create key pair in client  ssh-keygen -b 4096 Upload public key to server  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.</description>

      <description>The Information Technology field is immensely vast, however, one can break it down in three core aspects.
What is IT?  Programming Computer Networking Operating Systems  The problem The issue is that most people, even ones on the field, fail to grasp the basics. They try to invent theories on what technology is, and end up abstracting what Information Technology really is all about. Information Technology is not Object-Oriented Programming, it is not knowing the history of a programming language, it is not touch-screen tablets in schools.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Designing simple and elegant software is far more difficult than letting ad-hoc or over-ambitious features obscure the code over time.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; suckless.org
We live in a really agitated world where information flows much faster than anyone could ever grasp. Due to the agile technological advancements and the appearance of new technologies every day, the demand for people on the Information Technology sector is extremely high.
However, because there is still so much software to write, there is no market pressure in the software space to ship high quality code.</description>

      <description>Linux on laptops The downside of Linux when it comes to laptops is that it&amp;rsquo;s very power hungry, however we can fix this by installing a power saving program called auto-cpufreq.
How to install auto-cpufreq There are many ways of installing auto-cpufreq provided at https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq.
However, I will install it from source code, since this way will work on most Linux distributions.
 Clone the git repository:  git clone https://github.</description>

      <title>Rust Ownership</title>

      <description>Understanding Ownership Ownership is what enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.
What is a Garbage collector? Garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management.
It attempts to reclaim memory which was allocated by the program, but is no longer used &amp;mdash; hence the name garbage.
GC exists to relieve the programmer from manually managing memory, which can be susceptible to errors such as memory leaks.</description>
