			<h1 id="what-is-cpu-cache">What is CPU cache</h1>
<p>CPU cache is a small, high-speed memory located on or near the processor core.
Its primary purpose is to store frequently accessed data and instructions,
reducing the time the CPU needs to retrieve this information from the main memory.</p>
<p>Cache memory is crucial to improve the efficiency and speed of modern processors
by minimizing the latency associated with accessing data from slower main memory.</p>
<h2 id="the-memory-hierarchy">The memory hierarchy</h2>
<p>Memory hierarchy is a structured arrangement of storage
systems in a computer, organized by speed, size and cost.</p>
<p>It goes as follows (from fastest to slowest):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Registers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fastest and smallest storage located within the CPU</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>L1i/d, L2 and L3 Cache</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-level caches that provide fast access to frequently used data. L1 being
the fastest and L3 the slowest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Main memory (RAM)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Larger but slower memory used to store data and instructions currently in
use by the system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secondary storage (Flash, Traditional)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Non-volatile storage that holds data long-term, access is slower compared
to RAM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remote storage (Internet)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Usually slower than secondary storage due to the latency caused by the
overhead of the communications between computers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, cache memory sits between the CPU and the main memory, serving as a fast
buffer that stores copies of frequently accessed intructions and data, thus
reducing the time it takes for the CPU to retrieve data.</p>
<h1 id="before-cpu-cache">Before CPU cache</h1>
<p>Before the introduction of CPU caches, processors had to fetch data directly
from main memory for every operation. This process was slow and inefficient due
to the significant speed difference between the CPU and main memory. As CPU speeds
increased this disparity became more pronounced leading to performance bottlenecks.</p>
<h1 id="comparison-of-speed">Comparison of speed</h1>
<p>Here’s a comparison of typical access times across different levels of the memory
hierarchy, note that this values are hardware dependant so this is just to give a general idea:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Memory Type</th>
<th>Access Time</th>
<th>N cycles</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Registers</td>
<td>0.2 - 1 ns</td>
<td>1 cycle</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>L1 cache</td>
<td>0.5 - 3 ns</td>
<td>1 - 3 cycles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>L2 cache</td>
<td>5 - 20 ns</td>
<td>15 - 60 cycles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>L3 cache</td>
<td>10 - 40 ns</td>
<td>30 - 120 cycles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Main memory (DRAM)</td>
<td>50 - 100 ns</td>
<td>150 - 300 cycles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Solid-State drive</td>
<td>10 - 100 μs</td>
<td>30,000 - 300,000 cycles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hard-Disk drive</td>
<td>5 - 20 ms</td>
<td>15,000,000 - 60,000,000 cycles</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Cache memory provides much faster access times compared to main memory, which
is why it is crucial for reducing latency and improving the performance of the CPU.</p>
<h1 id="how-cpu-cache-works">How CPU cache works</h1>
<p>CPU cache operates by storing copies of data from frequently accessed main
memory locations. When the CPU needs to access data, it first checks whether
the data is available in the cache. If the data is found (a &ldquo;cache hit&rdquo;),
it is retrieved quickly. If the data is not found (a &ldquo;cache miss&rdquo;), the CPU must
fetch the data from the slower main memory.</p>
<p>Modern CPUs don&rsquo;t just fetch the exact data needed for a particular instruction
when accessing memory. Instead, they fetch an entire <strong>cache line</strong>.</p>
<p>A cache line is a contiguous block of memory, typically ranging from 32 to 128
bytes in size, depending on the processor&rsquo;s architecture. The idea is that when
one piece of data is accessed, the data adjacent to it is also likely to be
accessed soon (this is known as spatial locality).</p>
<p>By fetching the entire cache line, the CPU increases the chances of future
accesses resulting in cache hits, thereby reducing the need for further memory accesses.</p>
<p>For example, when accessing an element of an array, it is highly probable that
nearby elements will also be accessed shortly. By loading the entire cache line,
the CPU can serve future requests directly from the cache, which significantly
speeds up data retrieval.</p>
<p>This strategy enhances the overall efficiency of the cache system by reducing
the number of cache misses, particularly the compulsory misses (those that occur
the first time a data item is accessed).</p>
<h2 id="cache-locality-and-spaciality">Cache locality and spaciality</h2>
<p>Cache performance is heavily influenced by the principles of temporal locality
and spatial locality:</p>
<p><strong>Temporal Locality</strong>: recently accessed data is likely to be accessed again
soon. Caches take advantage of temporal locality by storing recently accessed
data, anticipating that the CPU will need it again</p>
<p><strong>Spatial Locality</strong>: data located near recently accessed data is likely to be
accessed soon. Caches utilize spatial locality by storing blocks of data that
include the requested information and adjacent memory addresses.</p>
<h2 id="the-3-cs-of-cache-misses">The 3 C&rsquo;s of cache misses</h2>
<p>Cache misses can be categorized into three types, known as the 3 C&rsquo;s:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Compulsory Misses</strong>: when data is accessed for the first time and must be loaded into the cache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capacity Misses</strong>: when the cache is too small to hold all the data required
by the CPU, leading to some data being evicted and causing misses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conflict Misses</strong>: these occur in set-associative or direct-mapped caches when
multiple data items compete for the same cache line, leading to evictions and misses</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="direct-mapped-vs-set-associative-cache">Direct-mapped vs Set-associative cache</h2>
<p>Direct-mapped cache and set-associative cache are two common cache architectures:</p>
<p><strong>Direct-mapped Cache</strong>: each block of main memory maps to exactly one cache
line. This simplicity allows for fast cache operations but can lead to a
higher rate of conflict misses.</p>
<p><strong>Set-associative Cache</strong>: This type of cache divides the cache into several sets,
and each block of memory can map to any line within a particular set. This
flexibility reduces the number of conflict misses compared to direct-mapped
caches but can introduce additional complexity in cache management.</p>
