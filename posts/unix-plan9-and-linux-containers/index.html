<p>From UNIX&rsquo;s monolithic simplicity to Plan 9&rsquo;s radical reimagining of distributed computing, each

<h1 id="unix-the-birth-of-modular-design">UNIX: The Birth of Modular Design</h1>
<p>Born at Bell Labs in 1969, UNIX introduced a philosophy: everything is a file.
Devices, pipes, and even network sockets were files in a single global namespace.
Users interacted via &ldquo;dumb terminals&rdquo; while computation happened on centralized mainframes.</p>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>No isolation: Processes shared PIDs, filesystems, and devices.</li>
<li>Network opacity: Remote resources required clunky protocols (NFS).</li>
<li>Monolithic: Tight coupling made scaling complex.</li>
</ul>
<p>UNIX was revolutionary, but its flaws demanded rethinking.</p>
<h1 id="plan-9-what-unix-could-have-been">Plan 9: What UNIX Could Have Been</h1>
<p>By the 1980s, Bell Labs saw UNIX&rsquo;s limits. Plan 9 emerged as a distributed OS where every component was a service.</p>
<p>Key Innovations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Per-Process Namespaces
Each process had a private view of the system. /bin could be local or a remote server, /dev dynamically mounted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9p Protocol
Resources (even hardware) were files accessible over a lightweight network protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microservices Before Their Time
Authentication, storage, and UIs were decoupled services. A window manager was just a filesystem mount.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Why It Failed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Required specialized hardware.</li>
<li>Arrived too early &ndash; networks were slow, ecosystems fragmented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet Plan 9&rsquo;s ideas such as namespaces and network transparency lived on.</p>
<h1 id="linux-from-hobby-project-to-container-host">Linux: From Hobby Project to Container Host</h1>
<p>Linux began in 1991 as a UNIX clone but evolved into something more.
Its monolithic kernel prioritized performance, while adopting
Plan 9&rsquo;s /proc and namespaces.</p>
<p>The Internet Era:
Apache on Linux powered the web, but scaling demanded better isolation.
Virtual machines were heavy; developers craved lightweight solutions.</p>
<h1 id="linux-containers-plan-9s-legacy-realized">Linux Containers: Plan 9&rsquo;s Legacy Realized</h1>
<p>Containers solved two problems: isolation (preventing processes
from colliding) and resource control (limiting CPU/memory).</p>
<p>Kernel Tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Namespaces (PID, network, mount): Isolate a process&rsquo;s view of the system.
Example: A container thinks it&rsquo;s alone because its PID namespace hides host processes.</li>
<li>cgroups: Allocate CPU/memory per process group.</li>
<li>seccomp: Restrict syscalls (e.g., block mount() in a container).</li>
</ul>
<p>From chroot to Docker:</p>
<ul>
<li>chroot (1979) jailed filesystems but lacked resource controls.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>LXC (2008) combined namespaces and cgroups for full OS containers.</li>
<li>Docker (2013) popularized portable images and microservices.</li>
</ul>
<p>And Docker will not be the last, I believe better solutions like Podman exist and
many more will come as this technology improves and new security and performance
requirements surge.</p>
<h1 id="old-lessons-new-tools">Old Lessons, New Tools</h1>
<p>Plan 9&rsquo;s vision &ndash; of namespaces, modular services, and network
transparency &ndash; found belated success in Linux containers. What once
required a niche OS now underpins cloud-native ecosystems. Containers
are Plan 9&rsquo;s quiet victory, proving that good ideas resurface when
the world catches up.</p>
<p>As Plan 9’s creators noted: &ldquo;Old tools are used for new purposes.&rdquo; Containers
are those tools, reimagined.</p>
