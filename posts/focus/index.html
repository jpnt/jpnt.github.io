			<p>I spent years drowning in self-help motivational books and productivity videos. They all promised the same
thing: if I just optimized myself enough, I&rsquo;d find fulfillment. But I never did. The more I focused on myself, the emptier I felt.</p>
<p>Then I found the address to the meaning of life. And it wasn&rsquo;t in another productivity hack.</p>
<p>The problem wasn&rsquo;t that I lacked discipline. The problem was that I was pointing all my effort
toward the wrong destination. I was trying to build a better me when I was meant to be building something for God.</p>
<p>Someone told me something that clicked: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only two weeks behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two weeks to stop wasting the talents He entrusted to you. Two weeks to get serious about stewardship.
Two weeks to become the kind of person who&rsquo;s ready when God says &ldquo;go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because here&rsquo;s the truth: life isn&rsquo;t about becoming impressive for yourself. It&rsquo;s about becoming useful
for God. The goal isn&rsquo;t self-actualization—it&rsquo;s communion with God and service to others.</p>
<p>Every moment matters. Every 10-minute gap, every commute, every lunch break. All of it can be stewardship. Or it can be waste.</p>
<p>Scrolling endlessly, consuming without creating, living as a spectator-that&rsquo;s not just wasting time. It&rsquo;s
burying your talents in the ground. A tree that produces no fruits is destined for destruction.</p>
<p>The real question isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;How bad do you want success?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s &ldquo;How much do you want to be ready for what God has for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bad enough to delete the apps that numb you to His voice? Bad enough to wake up early to spend time with Him
before the world demands your attention? Bad enough to choose preparation over entertainment?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about becoming an egotistical bastard obsessed with personal achievement. This is about
becoming a humble servant who&rsquo;s actually prepared to serve.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the framework for when you&rsquo;re ready to point your heart toward what matters:</p>
<h2 id="the-two-week-stewardship-sprint">The Two Week Stewardship Sprint</h2>
<p>Pick ONE thing God is calling you to develop. One, not two, not three, one. One skill, one area of growth, one preparation. That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>For 14 days, treat every moment as sacred trust. Every spare minute goes to becoming more useful for His purposes.</p>
<p>Wake up: dedicate the first fruits of your day to Him
Commute: use it for preparation, not distraction
Lunch: feed your mind with what equips you
Evening: build what He&rsquo;s called you to build
Before bed: examine your heart and realign</p>
<p>Two weeks of this and you&rsquo;ll be shocked how much more prepared you feel to serve.</p>
<h2 id="kill-the-spectator-mindset">Kill the Spectator Mindset</h2>
<p>Stop watching other people live their purpose. START LIVING YOURS.</p>
<p>Every time you catch yourself consuming, ask: &ldquo;Is this making me more useful for God&rsquo;s kingdom or just making me feel comfortable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delete everything that keeps you a spectator. Your future in service is begging you.</p>
<h2 id="momentum-over-motivation">Momentum Over Motivation</h2>
<p>Motivation based on feelings will fail you. Commitment based on purpose will sustain you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait to feel spiritual. Start anyway. The devotion comes after the obedience, not before.</p>
<p>Your first step should be so small it feels laughable. &ldquo;Open the Bible.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pray for one
minute.&rdquo; &ldquo;Send one encouraging text.&rdquo; Then do it. Then do the next small act of obedience.</p>
<p>Before you know it, you&rsquo;re building something eternal.</p>
<h2 id="environment-is-everything">Environment Is Everything</h2>
<p>You can&rsquo;t hear God&rsquo;s voice in a noisy room. You can&rsquo;t serve well when you&rsquo;re constantly distracted.</p>
<p>Control your environment or it will control you. Create space for the Spirit to work.</p>
<h2 id="the-pain-of-comfort-vs-the-pain-of-purpose">The Pain of Comfort vs The Pain of Purpose</h2>
<p>This is the real choice. Not comfort vs discomfort. It&rsquo;s temporary ease vs eternal significance.</p>
<p>The pain of discipline, of saying no to good things for great things, of pushing when
you want to quit—that pain is temporary and purposeful. The pain of looking back and realizing
you buried your talents? That&rsquo;s the pain of regret.</p>
<h2 id="youre-not-broken-youre-being-redeemed">You&rsquo;re Not Broken, You&rsquo;re Being Redeemed</h2>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m beyond repair. But that&rsquo;s a lie. The same God who took our place on the
cross cares about every moment of our lives.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not perfect. We fall. We get distracted. We waste time. But grace meets us there. And then
we get back up, point our hearts forward, and keep running the race.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about earning God&rsquo;s love. He already gave that freely on the cross. This is about
our small &ldquo;yes&rdquo; back to Him.</p>
<p>Stop reading this. Go do something that prepares you to serve.</p>
<p>Two weeks starts now.</p>
<p>What will you do with the time He&rsquo;s given you?</p>
