			<p>What is focus? I like this definition: pointing your heart to what matters. Do now what you have to do right now.</p>
<p>And to be completely honest I am terrible at it. I get frustrated with myself for wasting time.</p>
<p>This is mostly because I either block on something that is actually important or because instead of doing what I have to do right
now I do another thing completely unrelated. That does not mean I am unproductive, I am consistently learning
a lot of stuff, I never take things for granted. And I tend to see multiple things at once.</p>
<p>And honestly, that needs to change.</p>
<p>Why? Because the human brain was not made to work on multiple cognitive intensive tasks at the same time.</p>
<p>I have to pick 1 task to focus at one time. And that 1 task must be what matters. What I actually have to finish right now.</p>
<p>But this is extremely difficult, I often lack the motivation to even start.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is so much resistence, even
after starting I feel lost making me want to give up. I get so frustrated and desperate not knowing what is the next step I have to do to finish my problem.</p>
<p>I have to switch from perfectionism to optimalism.</p>
<p>NOTE: A related post for this one is coming, on the aspect of organized thinking and solution of problems: architecture, the &ldquo;brain-post&rdquo;. As for this post, this is one is more personal and
for the soul, this is the &ldquo;heart-post&rdquo;, covering motivation and purpose in life.</p>
<p>Too much rambling, but atleast now with some context we may proceed. I hope at least this is more readable than AI slop.</p>
<h1 id="questioning">Questioning</h1>
<p>Not to sound cheesy, or ridiculous. Whatever, take it as you want it. But the question I asked myself was this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who am I? What am I beyond my name or identity? Beyond my family, friends? Beyond my dreams? Beyong all this temporary things what makes what I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That started everything. When I entered a more silent environment without constant noise, I resorted to this thinking. Since I can remember I had this strange inner talks which, although being fairly forgetten about, were about questioning what I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, therefore I am&rdquo; is a famous philosophical statement by René Descartes, well known in Latin: cogito, ergo sum.</p>
<p>And logically I say: Yes of course, I know that I am, but I am what? What am I that I am? Why am I? Who am I?</p>
<p>Basically that never got answered.</p>
<p>So I spent years drowning in stoicism, self-help motivational books, productivity videos, habit tracking, false
confidences, and many other things you may imagine. For some people that might work, but for me it didn&rsquo;t. I never knew who I truly was.</p>
<p>I thought that maybe if I just optimized myself enough&hellip; I&rsquo;d find fulfillment. I never did. The more I focused on myself, the emptier I felt. What is the purpose of pleasing oneself for the sake of improvement? Why? Why am I doing all of this?</p>
<p>Then I found the address to the meaning of life. I just had to point my heart to it (pun intended). It was not in another productivity hack. It was Meaning itself.</p>
<p>That address is the Son of God, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I was pointing all my effort toward the wrong destination. I was trying to build a better me when I was meant to be building something for God.</p>
<p>When I was a bit younger I laughed at this idea, I never looked into it. I made science and technology my god. Computers are my thing, I though how could an ancient story like this be true? No way. Or yes way?</p>
<p>Even if this is all false, I think we have to be optimalists. In the end I hope to have worked toward something more ambitious than only for myself or some corporation.</p>
<p>The problem was that I never actually looked into it. And if I did it was only superficially.</p>
<p>The more I study it the more things click. Science and technology are not gonna solve the worlds problems. In fact they have made some of them actually way worse.</p>
<p>Technology and science are not a moral agent. Science is science. Morality is morality. Morality is an universal, objetive truth. Killing an inocent life is always bad.</p>
<p>Now, who is the moral agent? Because we may agree on black and white matters, but when things start to go gray people are very subjective, that means they have no grounding for what they believe.</p>
<p>To have grounding or being objetive means being able to trace back to one, absolute, indivisible source of truth.</p>
<p>Morality needs a backbone. The one true almighty God. Who is Morality itself.</p>
<p>Morality is a person. That person is Jesus Christ who set foot on earth and gave us the perfect example by being Pefection himself.</p>
<p>Eh&hellip; I remember I used to say &ldquo;Only God is perfect&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id="two-weeks">Two weeks</h1>
<p>I once heard: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only two weeks behind&rdquo;. The more I think about the more it makes sense.</p>
<p>Two weeks to become the kind of person who&rsquo;s ready to do anything. Pick the thing you have to do right now and do it.</p>
<p>Two weeks to stop wasting the talents God entrusted you. Two weeks to get serious about some thing.</p>
<p>Because here&rsquo;s the truth: life isn&rsquo;t about becoming impressive for yourself, it&rsquo;s not only self-actualization. It&rsquo;s about
communion with God and service to others. Because yes, God cares about each and every person on this planet. He is not distant. Quite on the contrary, He is closer than you could ever think.</p>
<p>In this two weeks, every moment matters. Every 10-minute gap, every commute, every lunch break. All of it can be stewardship. Or it can be waste.</p>
<p>Scrolling endlessly, consuming without creating, living as a spectator. It&rsquo;s
burying your talents in the ground. A tree that produces no fruits is destined for destruction.</p>
<p>The real question isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;How bad do you want success?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s &ldquo;How much do you want to be ready for what God has prepared for you?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Bad enough to delete the apps that numb you? Bad enough to wake up early to spend time with God
before the world demands your attention? Bad enough to choose preparation over entertainment?</p>
<p>I do not want to become an egotistical bastard obsessed only with personal achievement. This is about
becoming a humble servant who&rsquo;s actually prepared to serve others.</p>
<p>When I say &ldquo;two weeks&rdquo; it can be other periods of time, but preferably LONGER. I would say two weeks is the recommended amount of time
to focus on a single thing with a deep level of research and thinking behind it. 1 day is too little, do not even try it. Choose ONE thing and do it to the end. ONE, not two, not three, ONE. One skill, area of growth or preparation. Your goal now is this singular task. All your deep cognitive thinking goes to it.</p>
<p>For these two weeks, treat every moment as sacred. When you wake up, commute, lunch, in the evening and before bed. You&rsquo;ll be shocked.</p>
<p>Stop watching other people live their purpose. START LIVING YOURS.</p>
<p>Every time you catch yourself consuming, ask: &ldquo;Is this making me more useful for God&rsquo;s kingdom or just making me feel comfortable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delete everything that keeps you a spectator. Your future in service is begging you.</p>
<p>Motivation based on feelings will fail you. Commitment based on purpose will sustain you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait to feel spiritual. Start anyway. Go to your local church. The devotion comes after the obedience, not before.</p>
<p>Your first step should be so small it feels laughable. Then before you know it, you&rsquo;re building something eternal.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t hear God&rsquo;s voice in a noisy room. You can&rsquo;t serve well when you&rsquo;re constantly distracted.</p>
<p>Control your environment or it will control you. Create space for the Spirit to work.</p>
<p>This is the real choice. Not comfort vs discomfort. It&rsquo;s temporary ease vs eternal significance. The temporary pain versus the pain of regret.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I&rsquo;m beyond repair. But that&rsquo;s a lie. The same God who took our place on the cross cares about every moment of our lives.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not perfect. We fall. We get distracted. We waste time. But grace meets us there. And then we get back up, point our hearts to Him, and continue the race.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t about earning God&rsquo;s love. He already gave that freely on the cross. This is about giving our small &ldquo;yes&rdquo; back.</p>
<p>Stop reading this. Go do something that prepares you to serve.</p>
<p>Two weeks starts now.</p>
<p>What will you do with the time given to you?</p>
