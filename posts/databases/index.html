<p>A <strong>database</strong> (DB) is defined as a collection of related data; A <strong>database management
system</strong> (DBMS) is the software that manages and controls access to the DB.</p>
<p>A <strong>database application</strong> is a program which interacts with the database at
some point in its execution; <strong>Database system</strong> is a term used for a collection
of application programs that interact with the DB along with the DBMS.</p>
<h2 id="file-based-systems">File-Based systems</h2>
<p>Before the database system there was the <strong>file-based system</strong> which is now obsolete.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>File-based system</th>

</thead>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>A collection of application programs that perform services for the
end-users. Each program defines and manages its own data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The database system emerged due to <strong>problems</strong> inherent in file-based systems;
Understanding these problems is critical and may prevent us from repeating them in
database systems.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Separation and isolation of data</p>
<ul>
<li>When data is isolated in separate files, it is harder to access data that
should be available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplication of data</p>
<ul>
<li>File-based systems encouraged and needed the uncontrolled duplication of data.</li>
<li>Duplication costs time and money to enter the data more than once.</li>
<li>It takes up additional storage space to have duplicated data.</li>
<li>More importantly, duplication leads to <strong>loss of data integrity</strong> i.e. data
is no longer consistent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data dependence</p>
<ul>
<li>The physical structure and storage of the data files and records are defined
in the application code; Meaning that changing an already existing structure
difficult.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incompatible file formats</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure of files is embedded in the application programs, making them
dependent on the application programming language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed queries/proliferation of application programs</p>
<ul>
<li>File-based systems are very dependent upon the application developer, who
has to write any queries that are required; There was no facility for asking
unplanned or <em>ad hoc</em> queries about the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-database-approach">The Database Approach</h2>
<p>These limitations of the file-based approach can be attributed to two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The definition of data is embedded into the application programs; It should be
stored separately and independently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no control over the access and manipulation of data beyond that dictated
by the application programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A new, more efficient approach was required. Then the Database and the
DBMS emerged.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A shared collection of logically related data and its description,
designed to meet the information needs of an organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The database is no longer owned by one department but is a shared corporate
resource. It is a single repository of data that can be used simultaneously by
many departments and users.</p>
<p>A database is also defined as a <em>self-describing
collection of integrated records</em> because it contains the description of the data,
known as system catalog (or metadata); This nature of the database is what provides
program-data independence.</p>
<p>Another very important aspect in the definition of a database is the concept of
<em>logically related</em>. When analyzing the information needs of an organization,
we need to identify <strong>entities</strong>, <strong>attributes</strong> and <strong>relationships</strong>; Attributes
are the properties of entities and a relationship is an association between entities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A software system that enables users to define, create, maintain, and
control access to the database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Database Management System provides the following facilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Allow users to define the database, through a Data Definition Language (DDL);
Specifying data types and structures and the restrictions on the data to be stored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow users to insert, update, delete and retrieve data through a Data
Manipulation Language (DML); The primary language for performing DML operations is
Structured Query Language (SQL) which provides specific commands like INSERT,
UPDATE, DELETE and SELECT which perform the corresponding DML actions on the data
stored in a database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide controlled access to the database; For example a security system which
prevents unauthorized access to the DB, an integrity system to maintain the consistency
of stored data, a concurrency control system, a recovery control system and a
user-accessible catalog, which contain descriptions of the data in the database.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>There are three models of database design, from top to down:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Conceptual Model</p>
<ul>
<li>Represents the domain model of the data used in the organization, independent
of all physical considerations.</li>
<li>Defines entity relationships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logical Model</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilizes the Relational Model (common in SQL databases).</li>
<li>Specifies entity associations.</li>
<li>Bridge between the high-level conceptual model and the physical implementation
of the database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical Model</p>
<ul>
<li>Describes the implementation of the database on secondary storage, including
relations, file organizations and indexes to efficiently access data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="normalization">Normalization</h2>
<p>When designing a database for an enterprise, the main goal is to create an accurate
representation of the data; Relationships between the data and restrictions on the
data.</p>
<p>Normalization is a database design technique that focuses on organizing data by
examining the relationships (<strong>functional dependencies</strong>) between attributes; It involves
a series of steps called <strong>normal forms</strong> to ensure the data is structured efficiently
while minimizing redundancy and maintaining data integrity.</p>

<p>A technique for producing a set of relations with desirable properties,
given the data requirements of an enterprise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="functional-dependencies">Functional Dependencies</h2>
<p>A functional dependency is a very important concept associated with normalization which
describes the relationship between attributes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>A --&gt; B
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This representation of a functional dependency means: B is functionally dependent
on A (or A functionally determines B). In this case, A is called the determinant.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Functional Dependency</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>Describes the relationship between attributes in a relation.
If A and B are attributes of a relation, B is functionally
dependent on A, if each value of A is associated with exactly one value of B.
(A and B may each consist of one o more attributes.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, if the determinants have the minimal number of attributes to maintain
the functional dependency with the attribute(s) on the righthand side, it is called
a <strong>full functional dependency</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>partial dependency</strong> means that there is some attribute that can be removed from
A and yet the dependency still holds.</p>
<p>Now a <strong>transitive dependency</strong> is another condition where A, B and C are attributes of a
relation such that if A &ndash;&gt; B and B &ndash;&gt; C, then C is transitively dependent on A via B
(if A is not functionally dependent on B or C).</p>
<h3 id="functional-dependency-examples">Functional Dependency Examples</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Dependency Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Functional Dependency</td>
<td>In a relation &ldquo;Employees&rdquo; with attributes (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department), &ldquo;Department&rdquo; is functionally dependent on &ldquo;EmployeeID&rdquo; if each EmployeeID corresponds to exactly one Department. In this case, EmployeeID is the determinant, and Department is the dependent attribute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Full Functional Dependency</td>
<td>In the &ldquo;Employees&rdquo; relation, if both &ldquo;FirstName&rdquo; and &ldquo;LastName&rdquo; depend on &ldquo;EmployeeID,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a full functional dependency. For instance, if EmployeeID 101 corresponds to FirstName &ldquo;John&rdquo; and LastName &ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; and no other EmployeeID has &ldquo;John&rdquo; as the FirstName, then FirstName and LastName are fully functionally dependent on EmployeeID.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Partial Dependency</td>
<td>Imagine that in the &ldquo;Employees&rdquo; relation, &ldquo;Department&rdquo; depends on &ldquo;EmployeeID,&rdquo; but &ldquo;PhoneNumber&rdquo; depends only on &ldquo;Department.&rdquo; In this case, &ldquo;PhoneNumber&rdquo; partially depends on the primary key &ldquo;EmployeeID&rdquo; because it indirectly depends on it through &ldquo;Department.&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Transitive Dependency</td>
<td>Suppose you have a &ldquo;Courses&rdquo; relation with attributes (CourseID, Professor, Department). If &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; depends on &ldquo;Department,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Department&rdquo; depends on &ldquo;CourseID,&rdquo; then &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; is transitively dependent on &ldquo;CourseID&rdquo; via &ldquo;Department.&rdquo;</td>
</tr>

</table>
<h2 id="first-normal-form-1nf">First Normal Form (1NF)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Contains only atomic (indivisible) values</li>
<li>Each row must have a unique identifier (primary-key)</li>
<li>The order of data storage is irrelevant</li>
</ol>
<p>1NF ensures that each column contains indivisible values, and it requires a unique
identifier (primary-key) for each row to distinguish them from one another.</p>
<h2 id="second-normal-form-2nf">Second Normal Form (2NF)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Satisfies 1NF</li>
<li>Every non-primary-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the entire primary-key</li>
</ol>
<p>2NF eliminates partial dependencies, ensuring that each non-primary-key attribute
depends on the entire composite primary-key, if applicable.</p>
<h2 id="third-normal-form-3nf">Third Normal Form (3NF)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Satisfies 2NF</li>
<li>No non-primary-key attribute is transitively dependent on the primary-key</li>
</ol>
<p>3NF eliminates transitive dependencies, ensuring that each non-primary-key attribute
depends directly on the primary key. Furthermore, it is worth noting that we do not
remove candidate keys.</p>
<h2 id="forth-and-fifth-normal-forms-4nf-and-5nf">Forth and Fifth Normal Forms (4NF and 5NF)</h2>
<p>While the concepts of Fourth Normal Form (4NF) and Fifth Normal Form (5NF) exist,
their practical application is quite limited, and they are rarely used in the industry.
Typically, database designs are considered to be adequately normalized when they achieve
the Third Normal Form (3NF).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="normalization-example">Normalization Example</h2>
<p>After comprehending these abstract concepts, it is essential to grasp how normalization
translates into the conceptual and logical models.</p>
<p>In the conceptual model, we focus on defining the essential entities and their attributes,
as well as the relationships between these entities; The goal is to create a high-level
representation of the organization data requirements.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the logical model, we delve deeper into the specifics of how data
will be organized and stored within the database; Creating detailed representations
of tables, columns, primary-keys, foreign-keys and relationships between tables.</p>
<p>Normalization contributes to these models by guiding us on how to best structure
entities, attributes, and relationships; Eliminating anomalies of data, such as redundancy
and ensuring a more organized data structure.</p>
<p>Now, let us go ahead and look at some examples.</p>
<p><strong>Initial Database structure</strong></p>
<p>Student table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>StudentID{PK}</th>
<th>StudentName</th>
<th>Course</th>
<th>Instructor</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Alice</td>
<td>Math</td>
<td>Dr. Williams</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Bob</td>
<td>Physics</td>
<td>Dr. Louis</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>John</td>
<td>Math</td>
<td>Dr. Williams</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: &ldquo;PK&rdquo; means primary-key and &ldquo;FK&rdquo; is foreign-key.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We have a &ldquo;Students&rdquo; table with attributes: StudentID, StudentName, Course and Instructor</li>
<li>The table does not satisfy 1NF because the &ldquo;Course&rdquo; and &ldquo;Instructor&rdquo; columns are
not atomic (indivisible) values.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1nf">1NF</h3>
<p>In 1NF we ensure that each column contains only atomic values, we create separate tables for
&ldquo;Course&rdquo; and &ldquo;Instructor&rdquo;. Now, the &ldquo;Student&rdquo; table contains a foreign-key reference
to these tables.</p>
<p>Course table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>CourseID{PK}</th>
<th>CourseName</th>
<th>CourseCredits</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Math</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Physics</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Instructor table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>InstructorID{PK}</th>
<th>IntructorName</th>
<th>Acronym</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Dr. Williams</td>
<td>drw</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Dr. Louis</td>
<td>drl</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Student table (after 1NF):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>StudentID{PK}</th>
<th>StudentName</th>
<th>CourseID{FK}</th>
<th>InstructorID{FK}</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>Alice</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>Bob</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>John</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="2nf">2NF</h3>
<p>In 2NF, we ensure that non-primary-key attributes are fully functionally dependent
on the primary-key. To help demonstrate 2NF, I will introduce a new relationship:
&ldquo;CourseRegistration&rdquo; to handle the registration of students for specific courses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: In cases where you have a many-to-many association between tables, it is
often necessary to create a new entity, known as a relationship entity in order to
properly manage this association. This intermediate entity helps resolve many-to-many
relationships in a relational database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CourseRegistration table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>StudentID{FK}</th>
<th>CourseID{FK}</th>
<th>RegistrationDate</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>101</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2023-01-13</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>102</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>2023-04-20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>103</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2022-9-19</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="3nf">3NF</h3>
<p>In 3NF, we ensure that no non-primary-key attribute is transitively dependent on
the primary key. To demonstrate this, let&rsquo;s introduce a new concept: &ldquo;Department&rdquo;
to handle the department of each instructor.</p>
<p>Department table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>DepartmentID{PK}</th>
<th>DepartmentName</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Mathematics</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Physics</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Instructor table (after 3NF):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>InstructorID{PK}</th>
<th>InstructorName</th>
<th>Acronym</th>
<th>DepartmentID{FK}</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Dr. Williams</td>
<td>drw</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Dr. Louis</td>
<td>drl</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This arrangement satisfies 3NF as there are no transitive dependencies; each non-primary-key
attribute (InstructorName, Acronym) depends directly on the primary key (InstructorID), and
the department information is now separate.</p>
<p>With this 3NF structure, our database is well-organized, and data integrity is maintained.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have explored the evolution of information management, from outdated file-based
systems to databases. The introduction of DBMS has revolutionized how we create, maintain
and control access to data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have also explored Database Design, covering Conceptual, Logical and
Physical Models. However, the true star of the show was Normalization &ndash; a vital
technique that ensures data efficiency and integrity by resolving functional
dependencies and adhering to various normal forms.</p>
