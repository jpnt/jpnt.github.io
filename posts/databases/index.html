			<h2 id="introductory-concepts">Introductory Concepts</h2>
<p>A <strong>database</strong> (DB) is defined as a collection of related data; A <strong>database management
system</strong> (DBMS) is the software that manages and controls access to the DB.</p>
<p>A <strong>database application</strong> is a program which interacts with the database at
some point in its execution; <strong>Database system</strong> is a term used for a collection
of application programs that interact with the DB along with the DBMS.</p>
<h2 id="file-based-systems">File-Based systems</h2>
<p>Before the database system there was the <strong>file-based system</strong> which is now obsolete.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>File-based system</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>A collection of application programs that perform services for the
end-users. Each program defines and manages its own data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The database system emerged due to <strong>problems</strong> inherent in file-based systems;
Understanding these problems is critical and may prevent us from repeating them in
database systems.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Separation an isolation of data</p>
<ul>
<li>When data is isolated in separate files, it is harder to access data that
should be available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duplication of data</p>
<ul>
<li>File-based systems encouraged and needed the uncontrolled duplication of data.</li>
<li>Duplication costs time and money to enter the data more than once.</li>
<li>It takes up additional storage space to have duplicated data.</li>
<li>More importantly, duplication leads to <strong>loss of data integrity</strong> i.e. data
is no longer consistent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data dependence</p>
<ul>
<li>The physical structure and storage of the data files and records are defined
in the application code; Meaning that changing an already existing structure
difficult.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incompatible file formats</p>
<ul>
<li>The structure of files is embedded in the application programs, making them
dependent on the application programming language.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed queries/proliferation of application programs</p>
<ul>
<li>File-based systems are very dependent upon the application developer, who
has to write any queries that are required; There was no facility for asking
unplanned or <em>ad hoc</em> queries about the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-database-approach">The Database Approach</h2>
<p>These limitations of the file-based approach can be attributed to two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The definition of data is embedded into the application programs; It should be
stored separately and independently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no control over the access and manipulation of data beyond that dictated
by the application programs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A new, more efficient approach was required. Then the Database and the
DBMS emerged.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Database</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>A shared collection of logically related data and its description,
designed to meet the information needs of an organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The database is no longer owned by one department but is a shared corporate
resource. It is a single repository of data that can be used simultaneously by
many departments and users.</p>
<p>A database is also defined as a <em>self-describing
collection of integrated records</em> because it contains the description of the data,
known as system catalog (or metadata); This nature of the database is what provides
program-data independence.</p>
<p>Another very important aspect in the definition of a database is the concept of
<em>logically related</em>. When analyzing the information needs of an organization,
we need to identify <strong>entities</strong>, <strong>attributes</strong> and <strong>relationships</strong>; Attributes
are the properties of entities and a relationship is an association between entities.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>DBMS</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>A software system that enables users to define, create, maintain, and
control access to the database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Database Management System provides the following facilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Allow users to define the database, through a Data Definition Language (DDL);
Specifying data types and structures and the restrictions on the data to be stored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow users to insert, update, delete and retrieve data through a Data
Manipulation Language (DML); The primary language for performing DML operations is
Structured Query Language (SQL) which provides specific commands like INSERT,
UPDATE, DELETE and SELECT which perform the corresponding DML actions on the data
stored in a database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide controlled access to the database; For example a security system which
prevents unauthorized access to the DB, an integrity system to maintain the consistency
of stored data, a concurrency control system, a recovery control system and a
user-accessible catalog, which contain descriptions of the data in the database.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Application Programs</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>A computer program that interacts with the database by issuing
an appropriate request (typically an SQL statement) to the DBMS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Users may interact with the database through application programs that are used
to create and maintain the database and to generate information.</p>
<h2 id="database-design">Database Design</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Database Design</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>The process of creating a design that will support the enterprise’s mission
statement and mission objectives for the required database system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are three models of database design, from top to down:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Conceptual Model</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain Model of the data used in the organization, independent of all physical
considerations</li>
<li>Class association</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logical Model</p>
<ul>
<li>Relational Model (in SQL databases)</li>
<li>Entity association</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical Model</p>
<ul>
<li>Description of the implementation of the database on secondary storage; describing
the relations, file organizations and indexes to efficiently access data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="normalization">Normalization</h2>
<p>When designing a database for an enterprise, the main goal is to create an accurate
representation of the data; Relationships between the data and restrictions on the
data.</p>
<p>Normalization is a database design technique that focuses on organizing data by
examining the relationships (<strong>functional dependencies</strong>) between attributes; It involves
a series of steps called <strong>normal forms</strong> to ensure the data is structured efficiently
while minimizing redundancy and maintaining data integrity.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Normalization</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>A technique for producing a set of relations with desirable properties,
given the data requirements of an enterprise.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="functional-dependencies">Functional Dependencies</h2>
<p>A functional dependency is a very important concept associated with normalization which
describes the relationship between attributes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>A --&gt; B
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This representation of a functional dependency means: B is functionally dependent
on A (or A functionally determines B). In this case, A is called the determinant.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Functional Dependency</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</table>
<blockquote>
<p>Describes the relationship between attributes in a relation.
If A and B are attributes of a relation, B is functionally
dependent on A, if each value of a is associated with exactly one value of B.
(A and B may each consist of one o more attributes.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, if the determinants have the minimal number of attributes to maintain
the functional dependency with the attribute(s) on the righthand side, it is called
a <strong>full functional dependency</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>partial dependency</strong> means that there is some attribute that can be removed from
A and yet the dependency still holds.</p>
<p>Now a <strong>transitive dependency</strong> is another condition where A, B and C are attributes of a
relation such that if A &ndash;&gt; B and B &ndash;&gt; C, then C is transitively dependent on A via B
(if A is not functionally dependent on B or C).</p>
<h2 id="first-normal-form-1nf">First Normal Form (1NF)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Contains only atomic (indivisible/in the simplest form) values</li>
<li>Each row must be uniquely identified through a primary key</li>
<li>The order of data storage is irrelevant</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="second-normal-form-2nf">Second Normal Form (2NF)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Satisfies 1NF</li>
<li>Every non-primary-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary-key</li>
</ol>
<p>It eliminates partial dependencies, ensuring that each non-primary-key attribute
depends on the entire primary key.</p>
<h2 id="third-normal-form-3nf">Third Normal Form (3NF)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Satisfies 2NF</li>
<li>No non-primary-key attribute is transitively dependent on the primary-key</li>
</ol>
<p>It eliminates transitive dependencies, ensuring that each non-primary-key attribute
depends directly on the primary key.</p>
