			<h1 id="introduction-the-problem">Introduction: The Problem</h1>
<p>The growing complexity and size of modern software is a significant issue, which
I have discussed previously <a href="https://jpnt.github.io/posts/modern-software/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Today, software tends to be bloated, with enormous and complex codebases that can
consist of tens of millions of lines of code and intricate dependency trees, often
just to perform simple tasks.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t always like this. In the past, when computers had limited processing
power, developers had less freedom and were compelled to solve problems in more
efficient ways.</p>
<h2 id="modern-software-design">Modern Software Design</h2>
<p>Modern software design is fundamentally flawed. Theories such as Object-Oriented
Design and Domain-Driven Design often fail in practice because they do not align
with how computers actually work. The domain should be the memory, and the design
should focus on code and data structures.</p>
<p>These theories often introduce new problems, including maintainability issues,
poor performance, lack of security, and degraded user experience.</p>
<h2 id="kernel-design-drivers">Kernel Design: Drivers</h2>
<p>Whether developing monolithic or microkernels, much of the focus seems to be on
driver development rather than actual innovation.</p>
<p>When something doesn’t work, the solution is often to write a new driver. This
approach creates a bottomless pit of complexity, as there will always be new
hardware to support, leading to more and more lines of code.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="rationale-how-to-solve-it">Rationale: How to Solve it</h1>
<h2 id="proper-design-bottom-up-approach">Proper Design: Bottom-up Approach</h2>
<p>Many developers have the mindset of adding layers on top of existing systems to
fix problems. This approach is not inherently wrong but cannot be applied universally.</p>
<p>An analogy is when something breaks, you have two choices: patch it up with duct
tape and hope it holds (and add more tape if it doesn’t), or evaluate why it broke
in the first place. Maybe the materials were unsuitable, or it was used incorrectly.
We might need to create a new component to handle the task properly.</p>
<p>While this may seem simplistic, it illustrates that modern software often uses
tools that are not ideal for the job, leading to suboptimal solutions.</p>
<p>To effectively solve these issues, we must evaluate our choices from the ground
up, avoiding unnecessary bloat.</p>
<h2 id="if-a-does-x-better-than-b-use-a">If &ldquo;A&rdquo; does &ldquo;X&rdquo; better than &ldquo;B&rdquo;, use &ldquo;A&rdquo;</h2>
<p>This principle is self-explanatory: we should use the best tool for the job. By
doing so, productivity is increased, and we avoid relying on multiple suboptimal
software projects.</p>
<p>For example, if I want to display the contents of a file, I should use the best
tool available for that task. The same applies to editing a file, etc.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-it-stupid-simple-kiss">Keeping It Stupid Simple (KISS)</h2>
<p>A key principle in writing good software is to keep it simple. We should always
seek the simplest way to achieve our goals.</p>
<p>This principle applies to both the design and implementation stages. For example,
instead of performing extensive computations, we might pre-calculate and store
data for quick access.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also crucial to stay focused when developing a feature and avoid adding
unnecessary functionalities. This aligns with the original UNIX design principles.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-loc-does-it-take-to-do-x">How Many LOC Does It Take to Do &ldquo;X&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Another important consideration is achieving functionality with the fewest lines
of code possible, without sacrificing readability or performance.</p>
<h3 id="pre-emptive-multitasking-kernel-in-3000-assembly-loc">Pre-emptive multitasking kernel in 3000 assembly LOC</h3>
<p>Can we design a pre-emptive multitasking kernel in just 3000 lines of assembly code?</p>
<h3 id="virtual-memory">Virtual Memory</h3>
<p>How can we simplify memory protection while maintaining efficiency?</p>
<h3 id="video-display">Video display</h3>
<p>Can we create a simpler display server than Xorg or Wayland?</p>
<h3 id="usbnetio-etc">USB/Net/IO, etc.</h3>
<p>Can we design a simple and efficient I/O stack?</p>
<h2 id="zero-drivers">Zero Drivers</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, drivers are a major source of complexity in modern
operating systems. We could look to embedded systems for inspiration on how to
build an OS with zero drivers.</p>
<h2 id="restrictive-multitasking">&ldquo;Restrictive&rdquo; multitasking</h2>
<p>Multitasking is not inherently bad, but modern operating systems often run too
many tasks simultaneously. For a consumer/desktop OS, I might only want to run
2 or 3 tasks at a time. This allows us to simplify the pre-emptive multitasking
algorithm while still supporting multiple tasks when necessary.</p>
<h2 id="different-os-for-different-purposes">Different OS for different purposes</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a general-purpose OS; I want an OS tailored to my specific use case.
For example, if I&rsquo;m using it on a desktop, I don&rsquo;t need it to function as a server
OS. This specialization simplifies the entire OS stack.</p>
<h2 id="small-os-layer">Small OS layer</h2>
<p>The OS layer should be as minimal as possible. While POSIX provides a standard
interface, it is too large for my needs. My system is not intended to be POSIX-compliant.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="conclusion-thoughts-and-moving-forward">Conclusion: thoughts and moving forward</h1>
<h2 id="arm-and-risc-v-a-new-oportunity">ARM and RISC-V: a new oportunity</h2>
<p>With the advent of new ARM SoCs and RISC-V processors, there is a tremendous
opportunity to apply these principles and develop more efficient operating systems.</p>
