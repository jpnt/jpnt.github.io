			<p>&ldquo;The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level
in which one can be absolutely precise.&rdquo; &ndash; Edsger Dijkstra</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abstraction enables designers to focus on a manageable subset of the
system at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="abstraction-and-the-reality-of-the-fullstack-spectrum-in-it">Abstraction and the reality of the &ldquo;fullstack&rdquo; spectrum in I.T.</h1>
<p>Abstraction is the core of information technology. It is how in the field manage
the immense complexity inherent in our systems.</p>
<p>But, when talking about abstraction, I am not referring to the textbook definitions
or the OSI model everyone knows about &ndash; There is a deeper reality in this field,
a &ldquo;fullstack&rdquo; that exists beyond superficial client-server models. This stack
is not about trendy buzzwords &ndash; it is about the real layers, from the physical
world to the software running on your machine.</p>
<h1 id="from-physics-to-software">From Physics to Software</h1>
<p>Once again, what I meant by &ldquo;fullstack&rdquo; spectrum was a series of layers that
start at the level of physics and extend all the way to application software.</p>
<p>Each layer builds om the one below it, abstracting complexity, but never losing
touch with the underlying reality.</p>
<p>The model goes as follows, from bottom to top:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Physics</p>
<ul>
<li>The foundation of everything. Without it, nothing else exists. This is
where concepts of energy and matter &ndash; forming electrons, set the stage
for everything above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devices</p>
<ul>
<li>Here, we move into the reality of physical hardware &ndash; transistors, resitors,
capacitors, etc. These are the building blocks that enable the flow of
electricity that powers everything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analog Circuits</p>
<ul>
<li>At this level, we deal with continuous signals. Analog circuits handle
things such as voltage regulation and signal amplification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Digital Circuits</p>
<ul>
<li>This is where binary logic comes. Analog signals get converted to digital,
and from there, we can manipulate those 1s and 0s in meaningful ways.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logic</p>
<ul>
<li>The abstraction of raw digital signals into logical operations &ndash; AND, OR,
NOT &ndash; these are the fundamental operations that support everything in computing.
Logic gates, truth tables and boolean algebra all live on this layer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Micro-architecture</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of processors &ndash; how instructions are executed at the hardware
level. Micro-architecture deals with the design of datapaths, control units
and how these components interact with(in) a CPU to execute instructions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architecture</p>
<ul>
<li>Broader design of a computing system usually refers to the architecture of
a CPU. Here the instruction sets, registers and memory models are defined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operating Systems</p>
<ul>
<li>Where software meets hardware. The operating system abstracts the hardware
complexities, providing a consistent interface for the application software.
The OS handles resource management, scheduling and lower level tasks that
allow running software on top.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application Software</p>
<ul>
<li>The top layer of the stack. This is what most people interact with &ndash; but
it is built upon everything below it. Application software might seem far
removed from physics, but it is all connected through the layers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="the-importance-of-abstraction">The importance of abstraction</h1>
<p>Abstraction is not about hand-waving away complexity. It is about managing that
complexity in a way that allows us to focus on solving specific problems at
specific layers without being overwhelmed by the whole.</p>
<p>When you are writing an application, you should not have to think about the
physics of how electrons move through your CPU. That’s the point of
abstraction &ndash; it lets you work at the appropriate level of the stack without
getting bogged down in irrelevant details.</p>
<p>However, that does not mean you should be ignorant of what is happening beneath
the layer you are working on. Even if you do not understand the full stack,
<strong>for any task at hand, it is extremely helpful if you know whats happening on the
layer immediatly before and after it</strong>. This knowledge is what separates the good
from the great.</p>
<h1 id="precision-not-vagueness">Precision, not vagueness</h1>
<p>The purpose of abstraction is to provide precision, not to create vague, generalized
concepts. When you abstract you are creating a new level of understanding where
you can be specific and exact on the layer you are at.</p>
<p>Abstraction is essential, but it is not just about simplifying thigs &ndash; it is about
creating precise layers of understanding that allow us to build and maintain incredibly
complex systems.</p>
