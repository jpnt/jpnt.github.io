      <description>Linux on laptops The downside of Linux when it comes to laptops is that it&amp;rsquo;s very power hungry, however we can fix this by installing a power saving program called auto-cpufreq.
How to install auto-cpufreq There are many ways of installing auto-cpufreq provided at https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq.
However, I will install it from source code, since this way will work on most Linux distributions.
 Clone the git repository:  git clone https://github.</description>

      <title>Rust Ownership</title>

      <description>Understanding Ownership Ownership is what enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.
What is a Garbage collector? Garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management.
It attempts to reclaim memory which was allocated by the program, but is no longer used &amp;mdash; hence the name garbage.
GC exists to relieve the programmer from manually managing memory, which can be susceptible to errors such as memory leaks.</description>

      <description>Pop!_OS is a free and open-source Linux distribution, based on Ubuntu, and it uses the GNOME desktop.
It provides full support for AMD and Nvidia graphics cards out-of-the-box, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners.
Download Pop!_OS Go to https://pop.system76.com/ and click on download.
Pop!_OS comes in two versions: the latest, and the LTS (Long Term Support). I will choose the latest, since I want to use the latest features.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my personal website! My name&amp;rsquo;s João Pinto (jpnt), and my passions are Software Engineering, Low Level Computing, Computer Networking and DevOps / Automation / Deployment. Some of the programming languages I&amp;rsquo;ve used so far: Visual Basic, C, C#, C++, Python and Rust. I&amp;rsquo;ve not mastered any of these, but at the moment I&amp;rsquo;m just using Rust, since I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying it. </description>
