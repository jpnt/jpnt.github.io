      <description>Motivation Containerization has become a common practise of modern software development; Docker has been a popular choice for container orchestration, however, as the field evolves, new tools emerge.&#xA;One of those is Podman; one of the premises of it is that it does not require a daemon, unlike docker (dockerd).&#xA;This is one of the many more reasons people are starting to migrate to podman.&#xA;For more information I recommend reading: https://docs.</description>

      <description>Introductory Concepts A database (DB) is defined as a collection of related data; A database management system (DBMS) is the software that manages and controls access to the DB.&#xA;A database application is a program which interacts with the database at some point in its execution; Database system is a term used for a collection of application programs that interact with the DB along with the DBMS.&#xA;File-Based systems Before the database system there was the file-based system which is now obsolete.</description>

      <description>What are pointers? In programming, a pointer is a derived data type (like arrays, structs and unions).&#xA;Instead of storing values like normal types, pointers store memory addresses of another data objects. Hence the name pointer, because these addresses &amp;ldquo;point&amp;rdquo; to some data.&#xA;In short, a pointer is: a variable that contains a memory address (as its value).&#xA;We will see how they prove to be very useful and how to use them in the C programming language.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of programs to take notes on, however, if you use VIM, why not take notes on your own text editor?&#xA;Install a plugin manager Make sure you have some type of VIM plugin manager installed. Personally, I use ´vim-plug´.&#xA;Install ´vim-plug´ for VIM, on Unix based systems:&#xA;curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim Documentation is available at: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug&#xA;Install vimwiki Edit ´~/.vimrc´ to configure VIM and make it use vimwiki:</description>

      <description>The Information Technology field is immensely vast, however, one can break it down in these core aspects.&#xA;What is IT? Programming Computer Networking Databases Operating Systems The problem The issue is that most people, even ones on the field, fail to grasp the core basics. They try to invent theories on what information technology is, and end up abstracting real problems with layers of garbage that just create new problems.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Designing simple and elegant software is far more difficult than letting ad-hoc or over-ambitious features obscure the code over time.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; suckless.org&#xA;We live in a really agitated world where information flows much faster than anyone could ever grasp. Due to the agile technological advancements and the appearance of new technologies every day, the demand for people on the Information Technology sector is extremely high.&#xA;However, because there is still so much software to write, there is no market pressure in the software space to ship high quality code.</description>

      <description>Linux on laptops The downside of Linux when it comes to laptops is that it&amp;rsquo;s very power hungry, however we can fix this by installing a power saving program called auto-cpufreq.&#xA;How to install auto-cpufreq There are many ways of installing auto-cpufreq provided at https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq.&#xA;However, I will install it from source code, since this way will work on most Linux distributions.&#xA;Clone the git repository: $ git clone https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq.git Change the directory to the repository and execute the installer: $ cd auto-cpufreq &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo .</description>

      <description>Understanding Ownership Ownership is what enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.&#xA;What is a Garbage collector? Garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management.&#xA;It attempts to reclaim memory which was allocated by the program, but is no longer used &amp;mdash; hence the name garbage.&#xA;GC exists to relieve the programmer from manually managing memory, which can be susceptible to errors such as memory leaks.</description>
