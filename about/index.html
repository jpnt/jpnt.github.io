			<p>Welcome to my personal blog :-)</p>
<p>Usually I use the &ldquo;jpnt&rdquo; acronym because it sounds cool, but my
real name is João Pinto.</p>
<p>Born in the Azores, I&rsquo;ve always been curious about how things work under the hood. That
curiosity brought me to Porto, where I completed my Bachelor&rsquo;s in Informatics Engineering
at ISEP and I&rsquo;m now pursuing a Master&rsquo;s in Critical Computer Systems, focusing on real-time
operating systems, embedded systems, and systems-level programming.</p>
<p>My Bachelor&rsquo;s gave me a solid foundation in software development. I have worked across the
stack—building backends with .NET 8 C#, Node.js, and Java, frontends with React, and diving
into systems-level programming with C for advanced UNIX programming with threads, processes,
and system calls. I&rsquo;m comfortable with shell scripting (POSIX sh, bash, ysh) and use Python,
Go, Rust, and Zig for various projects.</p>
<p>During my internship at Sysnovare, I went deep on containerization technologies. I studied the
internals of Podman and Docker, compared their architectures and security models, and implemented
containerized workflows with CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions. The work focused on repeatable
deployment of complex systems, and I wrote a comprehensive technical report documenting my findings
and recommendations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m drawn to software that is efficient, minimal, and transparent—avoiding unnecessary abstractions
and indirection. Right now I&rsquo;m focused on advancing into container orchestration with Kubernetes while
deepening my expertise in embedded systems and hardware-software interfaces through my Master&rsquo;s program.
I actively contribute to open source projects and enjoy learning from others tackling challenging
technical problems.</p>
