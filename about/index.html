Usually I use the &ldquo;jpnt&rdquo; acronym because it sounds cool, but my
real name is João Pinto.
I enjoy Application Programming, Design Patterns,
DevOps, Operating Systems, Embedded Systems, IoT, Computer
Architecture and so on.
I have a preference to developing software at a lower level in
order to have the most efficient solution to the problem at hand.
At the moment, I am studying at ISEP (Polytechnic Instute of Engineering of Porto),
Where I have written many applications in Java, ANSI C, C# (.NET 8), Javascript (React),
and I am open to work on anything." />
