      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is focus? I like this definition: pointing your heart to what matters. Do now what you have to do right now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to be completely honest I am terrible at it. I get frustrated with myself for wasting time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is mostly because I either block on something that is actually important or because instead of doing what I have to do right&#xA;now I do another thing completely unrelated. That does not mean I am unproductive, I am consistently learning&#xA;a lot of stuff, I never take things for granted. And I tend to see multiple things at once.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
