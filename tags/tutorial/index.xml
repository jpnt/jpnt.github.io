      <description>There are a lot of programs to take notes on, however, if you use VIM, why not take notes on your own text editor?
Install a plugin manager Make sure you have some type of VIM plugin manager installed. Personally, I use ´vim-plug´.
Install ´vim-plug´ for VIM, on Unix based systems:
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim Documentation is available at: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
Install vimwiki Edit ´~/.vimrc´ to configure VIM and make it use vimwiki:</description>

      <description>SSH Daemon Configuration File The SSH daemon settings can be entirely configured through its configuration file located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Use your favorite text editor to change it.
Recommended settings:

      <description>Linux on laptops The downside of Linux when it comes to laptops is that it&amp;rsquo;s very power hungry, however we can fix this by installing a power saving program called auto-cpufreq.
How to install auto-cpufreq There are many ways of installing auto-cpufreq provided at https://github.com/AdnanHodzic/auto-cpufreq.
However, I will install it from source code, since this way will work on most Linux distributions.
 Clone the git repository:  git clone https://github.</description>

      <title>Rust Ownership</title>
      <link>https://jpnt.github.io/posts/rust-ownership/</link>

      <description>Understanding Ownership Ownership is what enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.
What is a Garbage collector? Garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management.
It attempts to reclaim memory which was allocated by the program, but is no longer used &amp;mdash; hence the name garbage.
GC exists to relieve the programmer from manually managing memory, which can be susceptible to errors such as memory leaks.</description>
