      <description>&amp;ldquo;Designing simple and elegant software is far more difficult than letting ad-hoc or over-ambitious features obscure the code over time.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; suckless.org
We live in a really agitated world where information flows much faster than anyone could ever grasp. Due to the agile technological advancements and the appearance of new technologies every day, the demand for people on the Information Technology is extremely high.
However, because there is still so much software to write, there is no market pressure in the software space to ship high quality code.</description>

      <description>Understanding Ownership Ownership is what enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.
What is a Garbage collector? Garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management.
It attempts to reclaim memory which was allocated by the program, but is no longer used &amp;mdash; hence the name garbage.
GC exists to relieve the programmer from manually managing memory, which can be susceptible to errors such as memory leaks.</description>
