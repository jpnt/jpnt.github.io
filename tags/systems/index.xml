      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;context-and-brief-history&#34;&gt;Context and brief history&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before threads as we know them today, operating systems already supported concurrency using multiple processes and hardware interrupts.&#xA;We’re talking roughly about the period from the late 1950s to the 1980s, before the standardization of POSIX Threads (pthreads) in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Early systems like IBM OS/360 (1967), MULTICS (1969), and later UNIX Version 6 (1975) implemented multiprogramming: several independent processes could appear to run at once by time-slicing the CPU.&#xA;Each process had its own address space and execution context. The kernel saved and restored the CPU state when switching between them. This gave the illusion of parallelism on a single-core CPU.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
